Full-stack web developer specializing in Ruby/Rails and React/Redux. I write practical, readable, and test-driven code. I'm an independent self-starter but always thrive best in a team. Find me brainstorming at a whiteboard, working hard under a pomodoro, or taking a break to refresh and joke with the team.
