I’m a newly minted, code-passionate [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/employers/) graduate looking for his first job as a junior developer. I’ve come from zero programming knowledge to be being a confident, capable and hire-ready junior in a little over six months. I'm a believer in software craftsmanship, an extreme programming enthusiast, and I can’t wait to get started.

I’m interested in full stack development in any language, but will happily work in any end of the spectrum if there is opportunity to evolve in the future.

## My story

I’ve come to coding later in life, mainly due to lack of exposure. I spent eight years travelling the world, teaching English and writing a book, all while searching for the right industry to ultimately direct my energy and talent. Through that experience, I met many programmers along the way who managed to convince me that though I lacked the skills, I had all of the qualities that made a good programmer, and that this obscure industry (to me at the time) was one that I could thrive in and enjoy. Thus began a curious and exciting journey to Makers Academy.

##What you can expect

####Expect me to learn fast and take the initiative
I’m not afraid to ask questions. I’m not afraid to say “I don’t know, but I’m going to find out”. Ask me, “Can you learn such and such in a week?” My answer will always be ‘Yes’. Why? Because I’m a junior developer and am probably underestimating how long it will take, but more importantly, at Makers Academy I not only learned the syntax of programming languages, I learned the underlying assumptions, concepts and best practices familiar to all programming languages.

####Expect me to be involved and get on well with the team
I’m an independent, self-starter in general, but I prefer a team environment. Whether leading or following, I love being in the mix, sharing ideas and contributing to a team initiative. At Makers Academy we either paired or worked as a team every day on the course, and this team environment is one of the main reasons I’ve stepped away from the solitary enterprise of writing. On a personal level, I’m friendly and personable, with a wide range of interests. I can build rapport quickly and easily with just about anyone.

####Expect a culture of excellence
I don’t just want to write code. I want to write great code. I’ve long had this spirit of continuous improvement and it’s something I honed as an aspiring writer. As a sentence can always be improved; so a line of code can always be improved. Making beautiful, elegant and practical code is a subconscious driver in all of my coding.

####Expect me to be resourceful
Long before Makers Academy taught me to google error messages, I was self-teaching myself French and Italian. I’ve moved country six times to non-English speaking counties, most times without a single contact beforehand. When I first started writing my crime novel, I had zero FBI contacts; today I have a phone full. Whether it's Google, Stack Overflow, Lynda or Tuts, I know where to find answers when not in the documentation itself.

####Expect me to be easy to manage
I love business and can empathise with the management, client and programmer perspectives. I’ve run my own English teaching business. I’m always flexible and willing to negotiate. I’m interested in working hard, having a good time and getting the job done.
